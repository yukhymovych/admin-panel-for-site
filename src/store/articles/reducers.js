      summary: "Feeling frustrated that your content marketing strategy doesn’t seem to be generating results? It might be time to switch things up a bit.",
      date: "24.03.2020",
      text: `Many people seem to think that the secret to content marketing is just blogging a few times a week and sending out the occasional email.

      But let me let you in on a little secret: Content marketing is much more than that.
      
      If you’re stuck in a content marketing rut and feeling frustrated that your current strategy just isn’t generating results, then you’re in the right place. In this blog post, I’m going to reveal a few ways that you can switch things up. But first:
      
      Whatever You Do…Be Intentional
In order for content marketing to actually be successful, it’s got to be intentional. The “if you build it, they will come” philosophy has no bearing when it comes to your content marketing.

So whether you decide to implement one of these strategies or all of them, make sure that you set your marketing goals beforehand and establish an objective for each strategy. Think about what makes the most sense for your business.

Now without further ado…here are a few content marketing strategies to consider:

1. Guest Blogging
Feel like you’re publishing content and nobody’s even reading it? Then you might want to look into guest blogging. Guest blogging for high authority sites in your industry can be an extremely effective way of establishing yourself as an authority figure in your industry, generating traffic to your site, and improving your SEO.

But take heed: It is time-consuming. Many sites (especially high authority ones) have very strict guidelines for the content they publish (often requiring posts that are over 1,500 words).

So you’ll want to be choosy about the sites that you guest blog on. Pick sites that have a similar audience as you. Even better if their posts get a lot of views and engagement. You’ll also want to check the Domain Authority/Authority Score of the site; the higher the score, the more good it will do for your SEO.

When pitching your idea(s), make sure that you review the guest blogging guidelines thoroughly beforehand and check that the topic you’re proposing hasn’t been covered before. Make it very clear why they should be interested in publishing your content and what value your post would provide for their readers.

2. Create More Visual Content
There are four different types of learners out there: visual, auditory, reading/writing and kinesthetic (or those who learn by doing).

For all your visual learners out there, it’s important to create visual content, like infographics and videos. Also, make sure that your written content includes attention-grabbing visuals.

Infographics are great because they’re highly shareable and great for link-building. To generate exposure for your infographics, consider doing the following:

Provide on-page SEO elements to where your infographic is placed on your website
Include an embed code for easy sharing and linking
Share repeatedly and across multiple social media networks
Target industry influencers directly with your infographic and ask them to share it
3. Get Talking with Podcasts
There are some pros and cons to podcasts, with the cons being the production and distribution challenges. But if your company has an industry expert who can go through a hot topic on their own or via a Q&A, then you might want to consider creating a podcast for your brand.

For added SEO implementation, these podcasts should be transcribed – with the text placed on the website – so that the content can be better indexed by search engines (inbound marketing software company, Moz, uses Speechpad to transcribe their data).

4. Create Long-form Content
At an average of eight seconds, human beings now have a shorter attention span than goldfish. And most people don’t finish the articles that they start on the web.

Given that, you’d think that it would be better to create shorter content. After all, that way your readers will at least be able to finish what they start, right?

Wrong. As it turns out, longer-form content not only ranks better in search engines, but it also tends to perform better with visitors. They also generate more shares and backlinks.

So just how long should your content be? According to SerpIQ, the average content length of the first result on Google is just over 2,450 words. And all of the top 10 search results in Google are, on average, over 2,000 words.

So if you can, aim to make your content length at least 2,000 words.`,

      header: "How to Ask Your Customers for Reviews (And Get Them)",
      summary: "Customer reviews are essential to your business’s success and growth. Here are some strategies on how you can get them.",
      date: "10.04.2020",
      text: `Surely you know by now just how important customer reviews are to the livelihood and growth of your business.

      If not, then get this: A whopping 90% of customers claim that online reviews impact their purchasing decisions. Not only that, but by knowing your customers’ needs, problems, and expectations, you’ll be better able to tailor your products and services to them. In doing so, you’ll increase their experiences with your brand and keep them loyal.
      
      But how can you actually get reviews from your customers? That’s what you’re about to find out.
      
      Where to Ask for Customer Feedback
      Before you start building your customer feedback strategy, you need to know what sites will allow you to ask customers for reviews.
      
      For example, Yelp’s review policies don’t allow businesses to request customer feedback. Still, this doesn’t mean you should avoid registering on Yelp. On the contrary, Yelp encourages businesses to provide exceptional experiences to each customer. According to them, that is the most effective way to gain unbiased and helpful customer reviews. On the other hand, sites like Google or TripAdvisor do allow companies to ask users for feedback.
      
      Your goal is to diversify your customer review strategy and adapt your approach and messaging to each platform you’re using.
      
      When to Ask for Customer Reviews
      You should also ask yourself when to look for customer reviews. For example, maybe you’ll find that you have the highest response rates somewhere between 1-3 PM, when your customers come back from their lunch break. Or maybe you’ll find that more people tend to respond at night. The only way you’ll know is by testing.
      
      By asking for customer feedback at the right times, you’ll be able to maximize response rate.
      
      How to Ask for Customer Reviews
      It’s one thing to ask for reviews. But how can you get your customers to give them to you? Here are a few powerful strategies that may help you increase your response rates.
      
      Send Email Surveys
      By sending your customers email surveys, you’ll personalize your relationships with them and show them that you care about what they think.
      
      When sending out email surveys, your goal is to grab people’s attention immediately and avoid being sent to spam. Here are some things you’ll want to keep in mind:
      
      Segment your email lists and adapt your subject lines and message copy to each customer group.
      Keep your survey short and concise. If your email survey is too long or difficult to understand, chances are, recipients will abandon it. To that end, your message should be to-the-point and your questions easy to understand. Instead of traditional “Yes/No” questions or open questions, consider providing multiple-choice answers that will guide your respondents and give you more comprehensive and useful information.
      Provide instant feedback. For example, if you receive negative feedback from the survey, you should reach out to the customer immediately to let them know that you’re working on resolving the issues they pointed out.
      Create and Send SMS Surveys
      Text messages remain one of the most powerful methods of sending a customer satisfaction survey. And, the reasons for that are multifold.
      
      First, customers use their smartphones to find brand information on-the-go and communicate with businesses in real-time. So by sending your survey via SMS, you’ll be able to maximize your reach and increase response rates. Stats prove that text messages have five times higher open rates than email, and their response rates beat email 7.5 times over.
      
      Second, people love SMS surveys because they’re direct, straightforward, and personal. They can serve as a perfect option when a phone number is all that you know about a customer.
      
      Try out different SMS templates, A/B test them, and then identify the ones that generate the highest open rates and response rates.
      
      Integrate Customer Feedback Forms into your Website
      A feedback form on your website will help you to improve your FAQ page and gain a better understanding of users’ shopping behaviors and preferences.
      
      First, determine the goals of your feedback form. Then, make sure you only ask questions that meet those goals. Here are a few ways that you can integrate feedback forms into your website:
      
      Ask for help center feedback. In other words, ask your visitors whether your help center articles were useful or not. Many popular brands, including Google, use this tactic on their sites. If a user clicks “No,” you can ask them for tips on how to improve your help center.
      Ask for feedback after cart abandonment. If a customer that spent a significant amount of time browsing through your offers suddenly decides to leave their shopping cart, then there’s a good chance that something went wrong. In order to find out what it is, you could create an exit feedback form on your page and ask users what happened and what would be enough to encourage them to follow through with their purchase.
      Implement feedback forms with your live chat. After helping a user solve a specific problem via live chat, ask them about their chat experience. Doing so can help to identify the major problems related to your customer support and fix them faster.
      Harness the Power of Social Media
      Consumers often use social media to search for peer reviews, stay on top of influencer posts, and voice their experiences publicly.
      
      And there are a number of ways that you can use that to your advantage and use social media to collect customer feedback.
      
      For starters, invest in a reliable social media monitoring tool that will help you track both your direct and indirect brand mentions. This will not only help you collect customer feedback, but will also allow you to participate in customer conversations in real time.
      
      You could also ask for customer feedback directly by creating social media polls. Social media polls are simple and engaging – all a user needs to do is click on the answer that makes sense for them. Once they cast their vote, they’ll be able to see the results of the survey.
      
      What to Do after Getting Customer Feedback
      Whatever you do, don’t let customer reviews build up and collect dust somewhere on your computer. Once you collect customer feedback, be sure to always thank your customers who shared their opinion. See negative reviews as an opportunity to resolve any issues. If you do that, you’ll undoubtedly increase customer loyalty and satisfaction.
      
      Finally, spread the word about what your customers have to say.  Share customer feedback on your Facebook page. Tweet them. Take screenshots of the most stand-out customer reviews and post them on your Instagram Stories. Put them on your website for the entire world to see.
      
      Keep in mind: Customers trust online reviews as much as their friends’ recommendations. So publishing customer feedback on your website and across your social channels will inevitably make your brand more credible.
      
      Deliver on Your Promises
      A customer feedback strategy can prove incredibly powerful in increasing customer satisfaction and retention. But in order to achieve that, you can’t just ask your customers what they would change about your brand and brand experience. You’ve got to actually use both their positive and negative feedback to improve your products and services.
      
      It’s a lot of work. But the good news is that it’ll pay off.`,

      header: "How CEOs Prep for the Next Day: 7 Bedtime Routines of the Super Productive",
      summary: "Follow these bedtime habits utilized by some of the most successful CEOs—and watch your productivity increase.",
      date: "17.04.2020",
      text: `Though we may not realize it, routines are an essential part of our everyday lives. But this doesn’t mean that all of our routines are beneficial.

      For example, many people are in the habit of looking at their phones right before falling asleep, but research shows that doing so can have adverse health effects.
      
      Developing a healthy bedtime routine is important because it can help you get a restful night’s sleep and set you up to be in a productive state of mind come morning. Some of the most successful CEOs, athletes and entrepreneurs have realized that and have devised healthy bedtime routines. Here are a few of them:
      
      1. Avoid Eating a Big Meal Before Bed
      Consuming calories late at night is not much different than during the day. But when you continue to snack before bed, you’re more likely to overconsume calories and take in more than you need, which in turn, can cause you to gain weight.
      
      Eating a big meal right before bed can also make it difficult to fall asleep because your body is working to digest the food. For that reason, it’s recommended that you eat your last meal of the day somewhere between two and three hours prior to sleep.
      
      Instead, you can replace unhealthy nighttime snacks with small, healthy foods that are easy for your body to digest, like different types of nuts. If you live an active lifestyle, you could also drink a protein shake made of casein protein powder before bed to help with muscle recovery. This type of protein powder can be easily digested throughout the night and help replenish amino acids.
      
      CEO That Does This: Me! As the CEO of Ice Shaker, I live a very active lifestyle on top of running my business. I drink a protein shake made of casein protein powder before bed to help with muscle recovery and fuel my body for the next day.
      
      2. Set Your Goals for the Next Day
      Get yourself ready for a productive next day by listing at least three things you hope to accomplish tomorrow. Whether you write this in a journal, on a whiteboard or on a small post-it, physically writing down your goals will get you in the right state of mind before bed.
      
      You’ll feel organized and determined to make things happen.
      
      Then in the morning, re-read these goals to remind yourself what needs to be accomplished and motivate yourself for the day ahead.
      
      CEO That Does This: Shark Tank investor, Daymond John, writes down seven goals at a time and runs through them each night before bed.
      
      3. Meditate
      Research shows that integrating a short, daily period of meditation improves health in a number of ways, both physically and mentally. Meditation helps to still the mind and destress the body.
      
      Studies have found that it can lower blood pressure, reduce pain and help with anxiety and depression, in addition to creating a calmer, happier state of mind.
      
      Practicing even just five minutes of meditation at night can leave you feeling more empowered and less stressed.
      
      New to meditation? Check out the meditation apps, HeadSpace or Calm. The idea is to sit down, close your eyes and focus your attention entirely on your breath.
      
      CEO That Does This: Oprah allows 20 minutes in the evening to meditate, and has noticed many beneficial results.
      
      4. Write in a Journal
      Journaling is one of the most effective ways to unpack the day’s events and is another useful method for de-stressing. CEOs are in positions with a lot of pressure, and many work through their high-intensity jobs by reflecting on their work and everyday life.
      
      Writing these thoughts down in a journal can help you to better understand the problems you’re facing and release tension before bed, helping you get a better night’s sleep.
      
      COO That Does This: COO, Sheryl Sandberg, keeps a gratitude journal that has helped her overcome tragedies in her own life.
      
      5. Read a Book
      These days, it seems like each of us is glued to our phones all day long, and the time right before bed is no exception. For many people, scrolling through their social media feeds or double-checking emails is the last thing they do before closing their eyes.
      
      The problem with this is that exposing yourself to electronic blue light late at night deceives your brain and body into thinking that it’s daytime, making it more difficult to fall asleep.
      
      Instead, minimize your interaction with that electronic blue light and take advantage of this time before bed to relax with a book, magazine or newspaper.
      
      Not much of a reader? Try listening to an audio book or podcast instead.
      
      CEO That Does This: Arianna Huffington, creator of the online publication Huffington Post, advocates disconnecting from your phone before bed each night for improved sleep. And Alexi Nazem, the co-founder and CEO of Nomad Health, claims that “I usually fall asleep with a book in my hand.”
      
      6. Avoid Exercise Before Sleep
      The most successful CEOs and entrepreneurs tend to exercise early in the morning before heading to work. Though it may be tempting to hit the gym later in the evening as a way to avoid waking up extra early, doing so can increase your heart rate before bedtime, making it more difficult to fall asleep.
      
      Instead, try creating a morning workout schedule for yourself to increase your energy in the morning. Drink a shake with protein powder prior to your workout for improved performance and longer lasting hunger satisfaction throughout the day.
      
      CEO That Does This: Mark Zuckerberg, Richard Branson and Tim Cook are all known for their early morning workouts.
      
      7. Establish a Regular Bedtime
      Going to bed at the same time is a very important part of a good nighttime routine. Reducing bright lights at night and inviting natural light into your room in the mornings will help regulate your circadian rhythm.
      
      Whether you’re a morning bird or a night owl, the important thing is that you are consistent in your sleep schedule and get 7-8 hours of sleep per night.
      
      CEO That Does This: From Jack Dorsey to Jeff Bezos, many CEOs out there have regular bedtimes that help them to maximize productivity and set their days up for success.
      
      Conclusion
      Practicing consistent, healthy habits before bed will allow you to sleep better and improve your productivity the next day.
      
      So take note of these tips and start establishing a bedtime routine that works for you. While everyone is different, finding your own best practices and keeping them consistent can make a world of difference in your productivity the following day.

      summary: "Prepping for your first trade show? Here’s how to ensure it’s a success.",
      date: "21.04.2020",
      text: `Trade shows are an excellent way to build relationships, connect with qualified leads and potentially grow your business.

      Planning a successful trade show, however, can be challenging for first-timers. It requires creativity, organization and resilience, as well as a willingness to step into the unknown.
      
      Ultimately, the amount of effort that you put forth when preparing for the event will determine how successful it will be for your company.
      
      Even for seasoned professionals, getting ready for a trade show isn’t easy. There are always several variables in play, and what worked great for one show may not be so great for another. For first-timers, figuring it all out and actually being successful the first time around can seem all but impossible.
      
      If you are new to the world of trade shows but want to start attending them to grow your business, here are a few tips on how to prepare for your first trade show.
      
      Start Planning Well in Advance
      Planning ahead is the number one most important thing you can do to ensure that your first trade show will be a success. This is one situation where waiting until the last minute never works out in your favor, so start planning as early as possible.
      
      Figure out exactly who will be representing your company at the event and inform them of travel dates as soon as you can. Book flights early to ensure the best deals and secure blocks of rooms at a local hotel before they sell out.
      
      And of course, be sure to pay for your space at the trade show as soon as possible too! Spaces fill up fast, so you definitely do not want to wait until the last minute.
      
      Figure Out Your Campaign
      Deciding who will be attending the event and booking all your travel and hotel reservations are just a few pieces of the puzzle.
      
      You also need to nail down your campaign for the event. Think about your goal and what you would like to accomplish. Are you using the event to launch a brand new product? Do you have major news to share? Are you trying to build awareness of a brand that you’ve just recently launched?
      
      Figure out what you want to do while you’re at the show and how to best accomplish it. If you are working on building brand awareness, you may want to stock up on swag, like t-shirts, coffee cups and tote bags, to give away to qualified leads. You should also order some smaller items, like pens and business cards, to hand out to just about everyone who stops by your booth or table.
      
      Prepare product sheets, price lists and any other documentation you may need during the event. Outline your sales pitch and what you will say to those who visit your booth. And practice it until it feels like second nature. Even if it’s your first trade show, you want to sound and act like a seasoned professional.
      
      Train Your Teams
      Chances are, you’ll have multiple teams from your company present at the trade show. You’ll likely have members of your executing, sales and marketing teams, so it’s extremely important to ensure that everyone is on the same page and has been properly trained.
      
      Create a document that clearly outlines your expectations and what everyone needs to do to ensure that those expectations are met. Also include phone numbers for everyone who is attending the event, as well as any other important contact information. Include meeting times and booth hours on the document and on everyone’s calendars.
      
      A week or so before the trade show, schedule a prep meeting. During the meeting, go over things like the schedule for the event, goals, hotel and venue information, dress code, booth hours, and any other pertinent information. Allow time for questions and make sure everyone understands what’s going on at the end of the meeting.
      
      Have Fun Giveaways
      The importance of giveaways cannot be overstated. Fun giveaways draw more people to your booth and get them engaged with your brand.
      
      You don’t have to spend a fortune, but you should be willing to invest a decent amount of time and money to come up with giveaways and activities that will draw people in and get them interested in your company.
      
      Get creative. Everyone is doing prize wheels right now. Think outside the box and come up with something else that fits well with your brand and the types of products or services you offer.
      
      If your business is a technology company, for example, you could come up with a simple computer game that visitors to your booth can play to win prizes. If you sell athletic equipment, you could set up a space where people can win various items depending on the number of basketballs they successfully sink in the hoop or how many strokes it takes them to get a golf ball into a cup. Skip the boring giveaways and come up with something that will draw people in and make them really want to engage.
      
      With that in mind, make sure you have giveaway items that people will actually want to win. You probably won’t have people lining up to play a game if the top prize is a pen. Smaller prizes are must-haves, but you also need to have at least a few items with higher perceived values to draw people in.
      
      Think hooded sweatshirts, jackets, and the like. Buying wholesale apparel for a trade show is more affordable than you may think, and it can have a huge impact on your success at the event. Consider offering a major grand prize like a kayak or a high-end cooler.
      
      Conclusion
      Getting ready for a trade show is a lot of work, but with proper planning, you can make it a success.
      
      Start by making your plans well in advance to ensure you have enough time to act upon any problems or unexpected tasks that come your way. That way, you’ll have more than enough time to refine your ideas and potentially even come up with new and exciting ones!
      
      Once your plans are set, you can train your team and give the show a test run with an on-site mock up. Being well-prepared should be enough to calm any pre-show jitters and work out all the kinks before the big day, ensuring a smooth and successful event! To take your trade show marketing further you could also look to utilize a range of digital marketing tactics aimed at event attendees before, during and after the event concludes. This article outlines some pretty good ways digital marketing can support offline events.`,

      summary: "Here’s how to brand an e-commerce company that your customers will be passionate about and loyal to.",
      date: "28.04.2020",
      text: `Businesses with strong brands do better. To make a name for yourself in today’s competitive marketplace, you need to give consumers something they can latch on to.

      Your brand is who you are. It’s your story, your personality, your messages and everything else that’s important to your company.
      
      Nailing your branding strategy right from the beginning is going to help drive sales and grow your company. But how exactly do you do that?
      
      A brand can be anything and everything you make it. There are no limits. Yet there are some things you should consider. If you try to be something you are not, your audience will see right through you, creating a disconnect and hurting your ability to engage. And while it’s still a very profitable company, no one wants to be Comcast, a company everyone hates but that succeeds because there are few other options.
      
      Instead, you want to build a brand people are passionate about and loyal to. And doing this requires chasing after the right strategy from the start. Here are some things to consider to help you choose the right branding for your eCommerce business.
      
      Create Messaging That’s Sympathetic to Customers
      One of the keys to choosing the right branding is understanding what people want from you. As a business, you exist to solve a problem or help people satisfy a need. To effectively create a brand that resonates with people, you need to demonstrate sympathy to the problems customers face.
      
      To give you an example, let’s say you’re running an eCommerce site that sells skin and hair care products. The first thing you need to do is ask yourself what problems your customers have.
      
      To do this, consider creating an Ideal Customer map. This is an exercise where you plot out the daily experience of your perfect customer, identifying pain points and matching them to the solutions you offer them.
      
      For our fictitious skincare company, the obvious pain points will come when people are exposed to the sun or wind or when it’s winter and the indoor heating dries skin out quickly.
      
      But what else? During this exercise, you should be able to distill other things people hope to get from the skincare brand they choose. Are there concerns about environmental sustainability? What about animal rights? Do people have extra interest in all-natural products? And what does that say about them?
      
      Doing this exercise a few times will help you figure out what messages will sink in with people. You can go beyond saying you’re a skincare products company, and instead say you’re a skin company that cares about nature, working to harness it to make people’s lives better in a sustainable way or something similar. This way, you are addressing some of the broader concerns people have when looking for a brand to buy from, and this will help foster loyalty and engagement.
      
      Make Sure There’s a Story to Tell
      A compelling branding strategy tells a story. This means there are characters, a problem and a resolution. The only difference between the story you tell and every other story ever told is that yours doesn’t have an end (we hope).
      
      It’s critical to make sure the branding you choose fits into this story. And to do this, you’ll once again need to get into the heads and hearts of your customers.
      
      As we’ve mentioned, the purpose of your business is to solve a problem or remedy a need. Yet the problems that exist in today’s world are large and complex. No one person nor entity can solve them all by themselves. So it’s your job to determine what your role is in this story. How are you helping to solve these problems?
      
      Maybe your job is to provide people with tools to help them solve their problem? Or maybe your role is to provide information and be a resource? It could even be your job to deliver hope.
      
      Obviously, these intangible purposes do not create revenue; it’s your products and services that do that. But by being clear about your position in this story, it will be much easier to determine the messaging. You’ll have a much better idea as to why people engage with you, and you can use this to create messages that reinforce the relationship you have with customers.
      
      Decide Something True to You
      Brand authenticity is necessary for successful branding efforts. If there is dissonance between what you say you are and what you actually are, people will see right through you and disconnect from your messaging.
      
      When choosing a branding strategy, or having custom merchandise created for your eCommerce business, make sure it reflects some aspect of you as a business owner, or your business as a whole, if you have a larger operation.
      
      So, after you’ve taken the time to figure out a message that resonates with people, and also your role in the story you’re telling, you need to figure out what you do best. All of these components need to fit together in a coherent manner so that your branding efforts will meld together and be more effective.
      
      If you’re passionate about the environment, it doesn’t make sense to build a brand around the idea of self-image and confidence. Perhaps this will resonate with customers, and so you, therefore, need to be aware of this audience preference, but don’t make it the center point of your branding strategy.
      
      Ensure You Can Produce Lots of Content
      Building on this, to be successful with your branding strategy, you’ll need to produce lots of content. You’ll need blog articles, infographics, videos, images, social media posts and much more to be able to reach your audience at as many touchpoints as possible.
      
      Make sure you can produce consistent yet unique content that reinforces your brand messaging. You don’t want to run out of things to say and start repeating yourself. Going over similar topics in more and more depth is good—and actually encouraged—but repetition will push people away and hurt engagement. You need to choose something that not only offers enough material for consistent content creation, but that you are also willing to dedicate yourself to for years to come.
      
      Choose Wisely
      It’s important to take time to get all this stuff right in the beginning. While companies have had success rebranding themselves, this is typically an expensive and time-consuming process we hope to avoid.
      
      Think critically about who you are as a brand and what your customers want from you. This will put you well on your way to choosing a branding strategy that can truly transform your eCommerce business.`,
